# Angular services #

This is the example code for my talk introducing Angular services.
If you didn't see the talk, I'm not sure this will help a lot.

## Running the code ##

Run these commands:

    npm install

    ./node_modules/.bin/bower install

    ./node_modules/.bin/grunt serve

## Additional resources ##
